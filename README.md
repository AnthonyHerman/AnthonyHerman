Seeking lulz is suffering. Creating lulz is manifesting your true self. - Johnathan Bobbatt III

"Thus, the nature of epistemic change in the QAI era is not revolution, but
redefinition. We are not witnessing a single moment of overturning consensus.
We are living through a continuous, distributed reorientation of knowledge
itself—one so quiet and pervasive that most will not recognize it until they find
themselves using words that no longer mean what they once did, and trusting
truths that no longer rest on familiar ground."
